## Problem 1 

We will read in and clean the "Mr. Trash Wheel" sheet.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

mrtrash_data = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>% #specify sheet to read in and skip row with graphic 
  select("Dumpster":"Homes Powered*") %>% #omit non-data entries
  drop_na() %>% # omit rows without dumpster-specific data (drop rows with missing data)
  mutate(`Sports Balls` = round(`Sports Balls`)) #round sports balls number to nearest integer
  
```
